22 FEBRUARY 2017 - BAN LAEM, PETCHABURI, THAILAND: A worker picks up her baskets of harvested salt during the salt harvest in Petchaburi province of Thailand, about two hours south of Bangkok on the Gulf of Siam. Salt is collected in coastal flats that are flooded with sea water. The water evaporates and leaves the salt in large pans. Coastal provinces south of Bangkok used to be dotted with salt farms, but industrial development has pushed the salt farms down to remote parts of Petchaburi province. The harvest normally starts in early February and lasts until early May, but this year's harvest was delayed by a couple of weeks because of unseasonable rain in January that flooded many of the salt collection ponds.

"""Photo: """"Dawn over Endless Lands"""" Maluti Mountains, Greater Drakensberg Mountain Range Golden Gate Highlands National Park, Free State Province, South Africa  Great was the expression of joy on my face when I waded through some images from a roadtrip last year and stumbled across this one! It was a morning I tried to forget for a while as we were on holiday and had to rush to the nearest hospital to get our 4-month-old daughter investigated for an unknown illness. Everything turned out okay in the end, but we had to cut our trip short by a few nights and actually spent that night in a strange town by a hospital bed while all kinds of tests were being done.  This is a pre-sunrise image, so I tried to maintain a darker look on the landscape while showing the immense detail of this beautiful vista. This is a blend of 2 exposures using a manual blending process in Photoshop based on gradient masks. +Jay Patel - would really like your honest feedback on this one sir...lay it on me!  Remember that tomorrow is African Tuesday again! The theme for tomorrow is Poignant People Portraits and you can submit any portrait-style photos of the people of Africa to the theme by hashtagging """" #AfricanTuesday PPP"""" and adding myself, +Johan Swanepoel and the page +African Tuesday to the post.

Layers of unparalleled decadence unfurl within this lavish estate nestled just minutes from I-25 in northern Colorado Springs. Over 1,200 sq ft of Tuscan-inspired outdoor living space crafts a resplendent composition that flows into a luxurious interior. Grounded by marble floors, an entryway steeped in grandeur sets the stage for an illustrious home to follow, including a nearby formal dining space with cascades of natural light. Revel in a great room defined by rich built-ins, a vast fireplace and floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the golf course. A kitchen with top-tier appliances, miles of wood cabinetry and an island with seating beckons endless dinner parties with the convenience of outdoor access to the built-in kitchen and balcony. Each bedroom is en-suite, including a primary haven equipped with a peninsula fireplace, expansive walk-in closet and a private balcony. The bathroom is a masterclass in spa-like allure with a vast shower, deep soaking tub and serene lighting. A remarkable lower level sets new standards for at-home entertaining with a wet bar/mini kitchen, pool room, wine cellar, velvet-wrapped theater and multiple vignettes for private conversations. A secluded sauna suite amplifies the resort-like appeal of this home, functioning as a private spa for a heavenly retreat. This is Colorado Springs living at its finest.

"""MacDougal Street Snowstorm"" January, 2014, New York City Fujifilm X100s, 23mm, f/2, 1/125 seconds, ISO 2500   This year was one of the  ten snowiest winters  on record for New York City. So there was no shortage of picturesque snowglobe-quality photo opportunities. But of all the winter photos that I took this year, this shot from Greenwich Village is my favorite. I took this photo while kneeling in the center of MacDougal Street. I snapped a few shots, played around with settings, and tried to compose something interesting. But then this guy stepped off the curb in the distance and crossed into the middle of street. Sometimes it's that tiniest of details that makes all the difference. The other photos from this series are totally unremarkable. This one is magic."

"Stunning backdrops, expensive gowns, strung-out couples on the most important day of their lives ... how much drama can be packed into a single photo? We asked well known destination wedding photographers for their most striking work. For a winter wedding at Lake Tahoe, guests bundled up in down jackets and boots and huddled in the snow. Photographer Aaron Morris of Chrisman Studios says the main challenge, aside from frozen hands, was maneuvering in the snow. ""When I would take a step, my leg would sink knee-deep into the snow,"" he says."

Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy ~ Composed of thin Englishman Stan Laurel (1890–1965) and heavy American Oliver Hardy (1892–1957), they became well known during the late 1920s to the mid-1940s for their slapstick comedy, with Laurel playing the clumsy and childlike friend of the pompous Hardy.[1] They made over 100 films together, initially two-reelers (short films) before expanding into feature length films in the 1930s.

Gothic painted Panel Virgin of the Angels by Pere Serra. Tempera and gold leaf on wood. Circa 1385. 195.8 x 131 x 11 cm. Comes from Tortosa cathedral (Baix Ebre). <br /> This splendid central panel and the two sections of the predella with saints (which must once have flanked a tabernacle) are all that remains of an altarpiece. It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and was painted for one of the chapels in the ambulatory of Tortosa cathedral, probably towards the 1380s. The compartment with the Virgin and Child surrounded by angels playing music is a very graceful and refined version of an iconographic type that was extremely popular at the time. Pere Serra, author of the altarpiece, came from a family of painters who grew to head the Catalan painting of the second half of the fourteenth century.

Specifically, a large portion of Enceladus pictured above is illuminated primarily by sunlight first reflected from the planet Saturn. The result is that the normally snow-white moon appears in the gold color of Saturn's cloud tops. As most of the illumination comes from the image left, a labyrinth of ridges throws notable shadows just to the right of the image center, while the kilometer-deep canyon Labtayt Sulci is visible just below. The bright thin crescent on the far right is the only part of Enceladus directly lit by the Sun. The above image was taken last year by the robotic Cassini spacecraft during a close pass by by the enigmatic moon. Inspection of the lower part of this digitally sharpened image reveals plumes of ice crystals thought to originate in a below-surface sea.

The sageuk trappings look familiar — royal protagonists looking conflicted, royal antagonists looking shifty and/or dark, court intrigue — but man, if that isn't a standout cast: Cha Seung-won, Lee Sung-min, Jung Woong-in, Jo Sung-ha, Eom Hyo-sub…  The drama takes place in 17th-century Jos...

life:  Beauty AND brains — Not too shabby, right? Hedy Lamarr: Hollywood Sex Symbol, Tech Geek…She  was a glamorous movie star of the 1930s and '40s, a taboo-breaking  beauty who is credited with simulating the first on-screen orgasm (and  also appearing nude) in a 1933 film called Ecstasy. But Hedy  Lamarr was a trailblazer in more ways than one: Fascinated by science  and eager to find a way to help the Allies during World War II, Lamarr  came up with a way to make radio signals jump between frequencies, and  thus prevent the signals from becoming jammed. After Lamarr and a  partner obtained a patent for the invention in 1942, she gave it — at  no charge — to the U.S. Navy, which began using it in the 1960s. Today,  Lamarr's breakthrough is used in technology like the Bluetooth wireless  device. Get to know Hedy Lamarr, the world's sexiest inventor.   I never knew that, that is fascinating.

"EXCLUSIVE: The heartwarming story was one of the biggest viral hits of 2014 - a lioness jumps onto a man and embraces him, in what can only be seen as a gesture of love. Approaching 10 million views on You Tube the ""grateful hug"" between a 140kg lioness and the man who saved her life was named on Google's inspirational list for 2014. The fascinating tale has now been made into a documentary series with an incredible twist - the man must teach the lioness to hunt. This six-part film tells the story of the abandoned and dying lion cub who forms a powerful bond of friendship and trust with a young German man - Val Gruener. The cub was left destitute by its captive pride on land owned by Willie De Graaff, of the Grasslands farm in the Kalahari of Botswana.Val, of the Modisa Wildlife Project, was given permission to try and save the cub's life. The pair became inseparable and now, three years later, every time Val opens the gate to her enclosure, he is hugged by the lioness that he named Si. (via Splash News)"

I took this about 7:30 AM in the morning while the moon was still out over the sparkling Queenstown. I set up the tripod on my balcony, and this is our amazing view! I'm renting a Bach here called ""The Nest"" – and it has incredible views all day long… and all night long too, as you can see! :)<br/><br/>- Trey Ratcliff<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2012/06/12/moonlight-clouds-new-zealand-at-730-am/"" rel=""nofollow"">Click here to read the entire post at the Stuck in Customs blog.</a>"

Lan Guihua, a widowed farmer, in front of her home with her typical day's worth of food in Ganjiagou Village, Sichuan Province, China. (From the book What I Eat: Around the World in 80 Diets.) The caloric value of her day's worth of food on a typical day in June was 1900 kcals. She is 68 years of age; 5 feet, 3 inches tall; and 121 pounds. Her farmhouse is tucked into a bamboo-forested hillside beneath her husband's grave, and the courtyard opens onto a view of citrus groves and vegetable fields. Chickens and dogs roam freely in the packed-earth courtyard, and firewood and brush for her kitchen wok are stacked under the eaves. Although homegrown vegetables and rice are her staples, chicken feathers and a bowl that held scalding water for easier feather plucking are clues to the meat course of a special meal for visitors. In this region, each rural family is its own little food factory and benefits from thousands of years of agricultural knowledge passed down from generation to generation. MODEL RELEASED.

"""Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (Besançon, 1809) was a politician, founder of mutualist philosophy and the father of anarchism. He favored workers' associations or co-operatives, as well as individual worker/peasant possession, over private ownership or the nationalization of land and workplaces. He considered social revolution to be achievable in a peaceful manner. In The Confessions of a Revolutionary Proudhon asserted that, """"Anarchy is Order Without Power"""""""

Anthony Bourdain Documentary Reignites Debate: Should Films Create Performances With AI?
Celtic Shipyards by Ronald Threlkeld Jackson, estimated to be painted sometime between the mid 1950s to the early 1960s; Ronald Jackson passed away in 1992. This painting is up for auction this month at Westbridge Fine Art Auction House, starting with a modest $800 first bid. Ron was particularly great at capturing the romance of the BC coast, so much so that he was often the artist of choice when it came to marketing our local tourism trade. In contrast to the grandeur of steamship travel, this painting showcases the humble side of Vancouver's shipping history. From Southlands.info:  [In] 1902…B.C. Packers bought Deering Island, until 1985 known commonly as Mud Island, and Celtic Island to form the Celtic Shipyards. The cannery was closed and converted to net storage. Subsequent developments included a marine slipway to service larger vessels. Eventually, the shipyard came to be the largest on the coast for servicing wooden boats and it handled all of the B.C. Packers fleet.  Today Celtic Shipyards slowly continues to disappear into history, with only a few remnants left to remind visitors of the type of work that once transpired here. Update! The painting sold for $1,100.
